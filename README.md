# Harry Potter Magic Awakened Jewels Hacks mod menu Code

Harry Potter Magic Awakened Jewels Hacks mod menu Code - Creatures always have three attributes: cost in the upper left corner, strength in the lower left corner, and life in the lower right corner. As mentioned earlier, when creatures slap each other during the combat phase, strength and life come into play. It is equally important to note that any modifiers for Power and Health are written as 0/0, where zero represents the modifier. For example,+2/-1 grants a creature 2 strength and -1 health.
